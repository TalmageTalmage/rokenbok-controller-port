# rokenbok-controller-port
This is a repo for using an Arduino to control a Rokenbok


TO DO:
Fix incredibly inefficient controller file (actual functions instead of giant if for each)
Support for up to 4 controllers (currently 2)
Make Arduino code actually shift bits instead of the current if chain
